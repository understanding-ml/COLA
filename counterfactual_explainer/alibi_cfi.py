            Parameters(general):
            :shape: shape of the instance to be explained, starting with batch dimension. Currently only single explanations are supported, so the batch dimension should be equal to 1.
            :feature_range: global or feature-wise min and max values for the perturbed instance.
            :write_dir: write directory for Tensorboard logging of the loss terms. It can be helpful when tuning the hyperparameters for your use case. It makes it easy to verify that e.g. not 1 loss term dominates the optimization, that the number of iterations is OK etc. You can access Tensorboard by running tensorboard --logdir {write_dir} in the terminal.
            :debug: flag to enable/disable writing to Tensorboard.
            
            Parameters(related to the optimizer):
            :max_iterations: number of loss optimization steps for each value of; the multiplier of the distance loss term.
            :learning_rate_init: initial learning rate, follows linear decay.
            :decay: flag to disable learning rate decay if desired 
            :early_stop: early stopping criterion for the search. If no counterfactuals are found for this many steps or if this many counterfactuals are found in a row we change accordingly and continue the search.
            :init: how to initialize the search, currently only "identity" is supported meaning the search starts from the original instance.

            Parameters(objective function):
            :distance_fn: distance function between the test instance and the proposed counterfactual, currently only "l1" is supported.
            :target_proba: desired target probability for the returned counterfactual instance. Defaults to 1.0, but it could be useful to reduce it to allow a looser definition of a counterfactual instance.
            :tol: the tolerance within the target_proba, this works in tandem with target_proba to specify a range of acceptable predicted probability values for the counterfactual.
            :target_class: desired target class for the returned counterfactual instance. Can be either an integer denoting the specific class membership or the string other which will find a counterfactual instance whose predicted class is anything other than the class of the test instance.
            :lam_init: initial value of the hyperparameter. This is set to a high value and annealed during the search to find good bounds for and for most applications should be fine to leave as default.
            :max_lam_steps: the number of steps (outer loops) to search for with a different value of.
